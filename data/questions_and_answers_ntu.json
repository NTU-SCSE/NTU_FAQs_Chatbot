It is thus expected to field teams for competitions and tournaments on a regular basis.

In our syntax, this may cause an account to be lockout under the following 3 situations:1. Your Windows PC is not configured to logon to the staff/student domain and you type a user name and any password when you boot up. 2. Your NT workstation/server is configured as stand-alone. 3. You logon to another domain other than staff/student, eg your lab domain, using Windows workstation/server. AND If you do the following :-&nbsp;Read your NTU email using Inbox or Outlook.&nbsp;- Connect to a file resource located on the staff/student domain by either mapping a drive, using the UNC convention, type net use in a MSDOS prompt, browsing to that resource using network neighbourhood, etc.&nbsp;- &nbsp;Check the print queue or print to a printer located in the staff/student domain. What actually happens is that the operating system will try to use the user name and password that you have type in when you logon to try to authenticate to the resource located in the staff/student domain. Eg. User test logons to lab1 domain using password \"hello\". He tries to print to a printer in the staff domain.The operating system will pass the user name \"test\" to the staff domain controller and see if there is also another user call \"test\" in the staff domain. If it finds one, it will use the password \"hello\" to try to logon to the user \"test\" in the staff domain. Everything works fine if both passwords are the same. The problem arises if both passwords are different. This will cause invalid logon attempts to the user \"test\" in the staff domain.In some cases, the operating system does a retry several times before giving up. This increases the invalid/bad logon attempts several times. You will notice this when you are sometimes prompted for a user name and password when you try to print or read your NTU email.Important : If your user name is the same on both domains and the passwords are different, you may end up locking yourself up. If they are different, you might be unknowingly locking out another user on the staff/student name who has the same user name as your local domain!

Examples of submission forms used in NTU include the feedback pages you see throughout the NTU pages, like the NTU homepage, and the Centre for IT Services feedback forms. Besides gathering responses from visitors, the interactive element also allows the creator of the form to use it as a simple kind of online application form. The Centre for IT Services' Helpdesk has an online fault reporting form. This is another use for this kind of simple CGI-based forms. The forms you fill in StaffLink and StudentLink applications are generally NOT the kind of forms we are referring to here. Those are more complex as they have to interact with a backend database.

It is an extension of Formmail.pl, a general purpose submission form. (Refer to <a href=\"http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits/gettinghelp/webpublishing/Pages/formmail_basic.aspx\">Using Submission Form in NTU</a> for details on Formmail.) SurveyMail is a Perl program that has been adapted from BFormMail.pl. The latter was written for Unix platform, but SurveyMail.pl was modified and enhanced for NTU's NT Web server. Like the normal Formmail.pl program, you will get an email detailing what the user has filled in, whenever a user fills in your survey form. But this time the responses will automatically be added into a text file in your personal Web account space, or anywhere in NTU's Web server where you have permission to write to. You can use the data in the text file in any software you like, e.g. Excel for tabulating and reporting purposes. (We do not teach you how to do it as it varies with the software you are using but usually the step involves importing a delimited text file.) Should you anticipate many responses, you have the option to turn off the emailing routine. (Otherwise your mailbox will be flooded with many entries.) Data will simply be appended into the text file as usual. If you suspect the program is not responding well at a later time, you can turn on the email feedback again. In the text file, fields are delimited with any character you like, and blank fields will be delimited by your self-specified delimiter in front and behind the empty field, leaving no space in between. A date and time stamp all automatically be placed as the first two fields in a record. If you have the email feedback turned on, you have the option to tabulate a subset of the input fields into the text file. That is, the email will show all the fields the user has keyed in, but the text-based data file will not keep track of all the fields. You have the option to tabulate only the fields you want. The text file is treated like a database. This file can be placed anywhere you want, even in a sub-directory in your personal Web account. With a one-time access to an NT machine, you can modify the Read/Write privileges of the file yourself, without help from Centre for IT Services. (Without modifying the file access privileges, the server-based SurveyMail program cannot write to your database file.) The advantage of being able to do it yourself is that you can give a meaningful name to your database, and you can place it in a location that is meaning to you. You can also have a few surveys going on at the same time since the each survey form can write to a different database file. But should you need help with the setting of file access privileges, we can help you with that as well."}, "qa924": {"category": "Home > IT Services > Computer Software > Website Hosting & Publishing > Formmail and Surveymail programs > Using Surveymail in NTU", "question": "Why is it that no records are added in my SurveyMail database file?", "answer": "Answer: If during your testing, no records are added into the database fields, check that these things are in order: Did you specify the drive field?

Logon to your Windows domain (staff/student) with your&nbsp;Network username and password. There are two main methods of getting to your personal web folder. [Note that the old method of connection via drive H is no longer in use.] Method 1: Via command line shortcut on the Run dialog boxYou will need to know your directory name. This method is very good for those using a later version of Windows like Win 2000. The reason is because the operating system keeps a very large record of past command line typed and has a smarter identification for folder names -- it automatically lists available folder names on the remote file source that best match what you have currently keyed in. E.g. if your home directory name is homeX and your username is testing, then type this at the Run... dialog box in the Windows Start button menu area.<a href=\"file://web/homeX/testing\">file://web/homeX/testing</a>&nbsp; Method 2 : Via shortcut on desktop If you like to drag and drop files to folders on your desktop, this method is most suitable. This is especially so when the PC is for your personal use. Create a shortcut to the personal web folder. You only have to do this ONCE. Right click on any empty area on the desktop. Select New -&gt; Shortcut Type in the path to your web folder. E.g. if your home directory name is homeX and your username is testing, then type \\\\web\\homeX\\testing at the command line (or location of file) dialog area. Then click Next. Give a name to the shortcut you have just created. You can name it anything you want. Click Finish. A new shortcut icon folder will be created on your desktop. Subsequently to edit files on the web folder, you simply double click on it to open your personal web folder on the Web server. You can edit the files there as per normal. You can also drag and drop files to this folder just as you would for any other folder that resides on your own PC.

And they do not have to type in the filename of the first page. E.g. http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits displays the CITS website. With a default home page, there is no need to type in a file name like http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits/index.htm The browser will automatically display the full path when the first URL is typed, if the directory has a default home page file. The advantages are that the URL is shorter, and not everyone remembers the filename. E.g. calling your first page as homepage.html is not a good idea as people may not know if it is homepage.htm or homepage.html or even homepage.asp The shorter the URL, the better. To have a default start page, the file has to be named specially. The allowed names are default.asp (for an ASP page) default.htm, index.html or index.htm. In other words, the content of this file will be displayed when net-surfers point their browser at your URL. E.g. There is no need to state the file name if you name your first file to be displayed as index.htm. [Note that no scripting, including ASP scripting, is generally allowed.] There can only be one file called index.htm in each directory. If you have multiple directories, you may like to call each of the first files as index.htm Try not to have more than one default file in a single directory. Because any one of them may be displayed as the default page depending on how the web server is configured. And if the default file display order is changed on the server, you may not get to have the right file displayed."}, "qa957": {"category": "Home > IT Services > Computer Software > Website Hosting & Publishing > Personal Websites > Technicals on Web Page Creation", "question": "Where can I learn more about HTML and the creation of web pages?", "answer": "Answer: There are some links to websites in the Internet that feature stuff related to web page creation, including online tutorials.

Subscribers can usually join&nbsp;or leave the list as&nbsp;they see fit. A mailing list is managed by a list owner (or sometimes several owners for large lists). The list owner is the person with formal responsibility for the operation of the list. The list owner defines the list's charter and policy, i.e. what the list is about and what are the general rules all subscribers must accept in order to be allowed to join the list. The list owner is also responsible for all administrative matters and for answering questions from the list subscribers.

Many move into neighbouring areas such as corporate planning, market research, financial analysis, or even become executives in their own right."}, "qa2611": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > Economics Programme", "question": "Why study Economics?", "answer": "Answer: Economics is a social science. It has close links to politics, sociology and psychology. Because it is about people and the real world, it enables students to learn about banking, finance, globalisation, growth, but also about broader issues such as the environment, poverty, the Third World and health. Economics is good training for the mind. It helps students to think logically, rationally and rigorously. Because they acquire problem-solving skills, students of economics gain access to a wide range of jobs."}, "qa2612": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "Can I Complete the English Major Programme in Less than 4 years?", "answer": "Answer: The NTU programme is designed as a four-year course. However, it allows well-prepared students to take more subjects during the semester and between semesters so that they can complete the programme, with honours, in less than four years."}, "qa2613": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "How is English Literature at NTU Different?", "answer": "Answer: The Major in English Literature at NTU offers students a great deal of flexibility in selecting subjects and creating their own fields of specialisation. Elective categories comprise Period Studies, ranging from medieval literature to postmodernism, World Literature, which includes an exploration of British literature's intersections with European literature and culture as well as a new emphasis on the New Literatures in English, Asian Literature &amp; Culture, Film &amp; Theatre, Literary &amp; Cultural Theory, and a category of specific interest subjects as wide-ranging as \"Literature and Madness,\" \"Text and the City,\" or \"Literature, Technology, and Science.\" The distribution criteria for the BA programme ensure that students can specialise within a number of these Elective categories in addition to fulfilling their overall requirements.This is an innovative new programme that combines a strong focus on the English literary tradition with new approaches to literary study and comparative literature."}, "qa2614": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "Is It an Advantage to Have Studied Literature at A-Level?", "answer": "Answer: No, not necessarily. Students who have taken English Literature, or literature in any other languages, at school may be familiar with some of the tasks - such as reading sometimes lengthy texts - and perhaps with some of the literary works. Reading literature at the University, however, is very different indeed from A-level teaching. The approach at University is not only more analytical and more challenging, but departs radically from the A-level syllabus and the methods practised at secondary schools."}, "qa2615": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "What are the Career Prospects for English Major graduates?", "answer": "Answer: Graduates can find stimulating and well-paid employment in a wide range of fields. The English Literature Major at NTU not only offers extensive training in critical thinking, advanced reading and analysis, and oral and written communication skills. It also addresses questions such as textuality, the social, cultural, and political factors behind artistic production, cultural and national identities, and the relationship between the individual and society, the critical analysis of value systems, &amp;c. It is thus an excellent concentration for students planning careers not only in academic research, but in consultancy, publishing, journalism, advertising, public relations, business, education, and the civil service."}, "qa2616": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "What Combinations of English Literature Subjects Should I Take?", "answer": "Answer: The New Undergraduate Experience at NTU is highly student-centred and the Division of English fully endorses this objective. After meeting basic requirements from each of the categories, students are given a relatively free choice. While students are encouraged to find, and create, their own areas of specialisation, as facilitated by the following overall categories, Period Studies, World Literature, Asian Literature &amp; Culture, Film &amp; Theatre, and Literary &amp; Cultural Theory, the selection from within and beyond them depends on the interests and intentions of the individual student."}, "qa2617": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > English Programme", "question": "Why Study English Literature?", "answer": "Answer: The study of literature is highly analytical, demanding and also facilitating the development of interpretative skills. It stimulates original thinking and critical habits of mind, the complex organisational and discursive skills involved in critical writing as well as an ability to read, in the broadest sense of the term, critically that is highly valued in the job-market - quite apart from enriching the way we experience life. Once you have learned how to interpret, to read between the lines, as it were, nothing will ever look the same again."}, "qa2618": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > General Questions", "question": "Do your university has Biotechnology Engineering?", "answer": "Answer: For the list of course offered by NTU, you may refer to <a href=\"http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/UndergraduateAdmissions/Pages/undergrad.aspx\">http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/UndergraduateAdmissions/Pages/undergrad.aspx</a>."}, "qa2619": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Humanities & Social Sciences > General Questions", "question": "Does Biomedicine course available in NTU?", "answer": "Answer: Medicine/Biomedicine course is not available at NTU.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;the School of Bioligical Sciences at NTU offers an undergraduate double degree programme in BSc.

There are also the large Electronics and Manufacturing industry clusters that employ physics, mathematics, and chemistry graduates in large numbers. In short, SPMS graduates, just like engineering graduates, will find employment and work together as team members all across the Singapore economy.We must not forget the government sector and the teaching service that also hire and require science and engineering graduates in significant numbers. The career choices are indeed numerous for a university graduate, and the most important qualities are a willingness to learn, adaptability, ability to anticipate and solve problems quickly, many of which are of a quantitative nature, and ability to work in teams as many problems are interdisciplinary by nature. The field of study, you're your content knowledge, whether it be physical and mathematical sciences or engineering seems to matter less in many careers in today's rapidly moving economy. And new careers are being defined all the time.There will also be a percentage of science undergraduates who will aspire to be like Yang Chen Ning, James Watson, or Andrew Wiles, and they will want to proceed further to undertake research leading to a PhD degree, either locally or overseas. As Sir Isaac Newton said: \"I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whist the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered all before me.\"So, job prospects for SPMS graduates will clearly be only limited by the mind."}, "qa2628": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Physical & Mathematical Sciences", "question": "What degrees are offered to SPMS undergraduates?", "answer": "Answer: The immediate destinations are:Bachelor of Science (Honours) in ChemistryBachelor of Science (Honours) in MathematicsBachelor of Science (Honours) in PhysicsBachelor of Science (Honours) in Physical Sciences.Your transcript will also reflect your Concentrations, e.g. Major in Chemistry with Concentration in Medicinal Chemistry, Major in Chemistry with Concentration in Green Chemistry, Major in Physics with Concentration in Nanoscience, etc."}, "qa2629": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Physical & Mathematical Sciences", "question": "Why should I choose to study physical and mathematical sciences?", "answer": "Answer: You may refer to <a href=\"http://www.spms.ntu.edu.sg/PropUndergrad/UndergradCourseFAQs.htm#Q3\">http://www.spms.ntu.edu.sg/PropUndergrad/UndergradCourseFAQs.htm#Q3</a>"}, "qa2630": {"category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Physical & Mathematical Sciences", "question": "Why should I choose to study the physical and mathematical sciences?", "answer": "Answer: What does Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr'dinger, Francis Crick, James Watson, Harry Kroto, Andrew Wiles, Emmy Noether, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Dmitri Mendeleev, Douglas Osheroff, Steven Chu, Yang Chen Ning, Lee Tsung Dao, Lee Yuan Tseh, Kenichi Fukui, and Daniel Tsui have in common?
